At times we might have to use sender id to let the end user know that message originates from your account/company as marketing strategy. Certain countries supports sender id out of the box, others requires them to be registered before they are used. In cases where sender id is not supported, a sender id of ```NOTICE``` will be displayed as SNS will alter it to ensure message delivery.


> [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/channels-sms-countries.html) for SenderIds would be the best way to get the latest information regarding supported countries, and any sender id requirements.
